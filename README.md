# Poker Hand Classification

## Project Overview
The Poker Hand Classification project aims to classify poker hands into 10 predefined classes based on the rank and suit of cards. The project leverages machine learning classification algorithms to accurately identify the type of poker hand from a given set of cards. This project includes data preprocessing steps such as Feature Transformation and Feature Construction to ensure the data is machine-friendly and addresses data imbalance, significantly improving model accuracy.

## Features
- **Card Rank**: The rank of each card (e.g., 2, 3, 4, ... , King, Ace).
- **Card Suit**: The suit of each card (e.g., Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades).
